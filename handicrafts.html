    	        <span class="line-separator"></span>
        	    <div class="page-details">
                	<p>A handicraft, sometimes more precisely expressed as artisanal handicraft or handmade, is any of a wide variety of types of work where useful and decorative objects are made completely by hand or by using only simple tools. It is a traditional main sector of craft, and applies to a wide range of creative and design activities that are related to making things with one's hands and skill, including work with textiles, moldable and rigid materials, paper, plant fibers, etc.</p>
                	<br />
                    <h2>Nature of Work</h2>
                    <ul>
                    	<li>Many handcrafters use natural, even entirely indigenous, materials while others may prefer modern, non traditional materials, and even up cycle industrial materials.</li>
                        <li>The individual artisanship of a handcrafted item is the paramount criterion; those made by mass production or machines are not handicraft goods.</li>
                        <li>Handicrafts are often integrated into educational systems, both informally and formally.</li>
                        <li>Most crafts require the development of skill and application of patience, but can be learned virtually by anyone.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br />
                    <h2>Common Problems encountered in making Handicrafts</h2>
                    <ul>
                    	<li>Problems of access to raw materials</li>
                        <li>Problems of technology and finance</li>
                        <li>Marketing problems</li>
                    </ul> 
                    
                    <br />
                    <p>Among the challenges of handicraft industry the scarcity and depletion of natural stocks of raw materials, the timely availability of raw materials and the finance, the discontinuity of craft skills, poor social recognitions of handicraft, poor income, migration to other jobs, reluctance to use new technology, high cost production are most important. Handicraft industries are less attractive to youth and they are closed in cities. Therefore, handicraft industry may not be a solution for the unemployment in rural areas. It can be developed if the tourist industry grows.</p>

									</div>
								</div>
								<ul>
									<li>Weaving is a method of fabric production in which two distinct sets of yarns or threads are interlaced at right angles to form a fabric or cloth.</li>
									<li>The other methods are knitting, lace making, felting, and braiding or plaiting. The longitudinal threads are called the warp and the lateral threads are the weft or filling. (Weft or woof is an old English word meaning "that which is woven". The method in which these threads are inter woven affects the characteristics of the cloth.</li>

								</div>
								<ul>
									<li>Tatting is a technique for handcrafting a particularly durable lace constructed by a series of knots and loops.</li>
									<li>Tatting can be used to make lace edging as well as doilies, collars, and other decorative pieces. The lace is formed by a pattern of rings and chains formed from a series of cow hitch, or half-hitch knots, called double stitches, over a core thread. Gaps can be left between the stitches to form picots, which are used for practical construction as well as decorative effect.</li>

									<li>It was long crafted by sailors, especially in elaborate or ornamental knotting forms, to decorate anything from knife handles to bottles to parts of ships. </li>
									<li>Materials used in macram√© include cords made of cotton twine, linen, hemp, jute, leather or yarn. Cords are identified by construction, such as a 3-ply cord, made of 3 lengths of fibre twisted together. </li>

								<ul>
									<li>Crochet is a process of creating fabric from yarn, thread, or other material strands using a crochet hook.</li>
									<li>The word is derived from the French word "crochet", meaning hook.</li>
									<li>Hooks can be made of materials such as metals, woods or plastic and are commercially manufactured as well as produced by artisans. Crocheting, like knitting, consists of pulling loops through other loops, but additionally incorporates wrapping the working material around the hook one or more times.</li>

									</div>
								</div>
								<ul>
									<li>Tapestry is a form of textile art, traditionally woven on a vertical loom. However, it can also be woven on a floor loom as well. It is composed of two sets of interlaced threads, those running parallel to the length (called the warp) and those parallel to the width (called the weft); the warp threads are set up under tension on a loom, and the weft thread is passed back and forth across part or all of the warps. </li>            
									<li>Tapestry is weft-faced weaving, in which all the warp threads are hidden in the completed work, unlike cloth weaving where both the warp and the weft threads may be visible.</li>
									<li>In tapestry weaving, weft yarns are typically discontinuous; the artisan interlaces each coloured weft back and forth in its own small pattern area. It is a plain weft-faced weave having weft threads of different colours worked over portions of the warp to form the design.</li>

				<h2> Philippine Folk Art </h2>
				<p>Filipinos are probably one of the most creative and colorful people around. You can tell this just by looking at the types of folk art that we have.</p>
				<p>Folk Art should not be confused with Indigenous Art. Folk Art is defined as "Art originating among the common people of a nation or region and usually reflecting their traditional culture, especially everyday or festive items produced or decorated by unschooled artists." Indigenous Art meanwhile is defined as any art form, whether it be literature, music, fine arts, theatre or film which is created by an Indigenous group.</p>

						<h3>Saniculas cookie mold carvings (Pampanga)</h3>
						<img src="images/handicrafts/SANICULAS COOKIE MOLDS.jpg" width="400" style="margin-bottom: 30px;" />
						<ul>
							<li>This folk art is elegant and beautiful as it is a dying art.</li>
							<li>Saniculas cookies are arrowroot cookies that have the image of St. Nicholas molded on it ergo the name Saniculas.</li>
							<li>St. Nicholas is also known as "the healer"  and is the go to saint for those who need "healing" from illnesses. </li>
							<li>Legend say that if you consume these cookies when one is ill, you get healed and recover in a shorter amount of time than it would usually take. </li>
							<li>Saniculas cookie makers would commission the carvers of these moulds with one of a kind designs. They would also have the initials of the owner monogrammed on the moulds. This is why it's so rare ‚Äì it is considered a family heirloom. The moulds are made of hardwood and are of different shapes and sizes. They would have a carved piece and a wooden presser. </li>
						</ul>
					</li>

						<h3>Pabalat or Pastillas wrapper cutting art (Bulacan)</h3>
						<img src="images/handicrafts/Pabalat or Pastillas wrapper cutting art.jpg" width="400" style="margin-bottom: 30px;" />
						<ul>
							<li>The wrappers are made out of delicate Japanese paper, they would inevitably tear or degrade. Even the way to make it is so delicate that only the ones with skilled hands and have perfect control of their motor skills can produce the best kind.</li>
							<li>This a dying art. Reports say that only Lola Luz Ocampo is the last crafts(wo)man of this art. However, Lola Luz has made it her mission to train and pass on her knowledge to the younger generation in Bulacan. </li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Taka (Laguna)</h3>
						<img src="images/handicrafts/The art of ‚Äútaka‚Äù or ‚Äútaka-making‚Äù.jpg" width="400" style="margin-bottom: 30px;" />
						<ul>
							<li>The art of "taka" or "taka-making" is not an exclusive Pinoy art.</li>
							<li>Paper mache and decoupaging have been around for centuries.</li>
							<li>In the Philippines, the first recorded or mention of a created taka was by a woman named Maria Bague in the 1920's. She has wooden moulds that were covered in strips of paper dipped in a sticky paste. She would later paint them colorfully and presented them as children's toys. Due to a fire though, none of the original takas were saved.</li>
							<li>Taka making became more popular during the American colonization period when there was an excess of newsprint. And because Pinoys hate wasting anything, the people of Paete decided to create more takas and even diversified into different animals and not just the traditional red horse.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Pagbuburda (Taal, Lumban, Laguna)</h3>
						<img src="images/handicrafts/BURDA 2.png" width="400" style="margin-bottom: 30px;" />
						<p>The art of embroidery is happily alive and flourishing in these towns. Although it's mostly done by women who are wives of the farmers and fishermen, it is not uncommon to see fishermen and farmers who are also carefully and delicately embroidering floral designs during their "off-season". </p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Singkaban or Bamboo Art (Bulacan)</h3>
						<img src="images/handicrafts/Singkaban or Bamboo Art.png" width="400" style="margin-bottom: 30px;" />
						<ul>
							<li>A fairly new type of Philippine folk art, Singkaban is the art of shaving bamboo into artful creations that can be used as decor for arches or for the home. Skilled craftsmen patiently shaves off the bamboo, layer by layer, to create curls and delicate twirls of thin bamboo. </li>
							<li>Singkaban is usually a celebratory art. Singkaban craftsmen create these gregariously designed bamboo arches for fiestas, weddings and other celebrations that involve the entire community. Perhaps it is our sense of "bayanihan" that inspired this artform ‚Äì ensuring that art is appreciated and is accessible to everyone in the community and their guests.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>

						<h3>Puni or Palm leaf folding (Bulacan)</h3>
						<img src="images/handicrafts/Puni or Palm leaf folding.jpg" width="400" style="margin-bottom: 30px;" />
						<ul>
							<li>Another dying folk art, Puni or palm leaf folding was intended to create artful toys for kids. However, puni can also be used to create woven baskets, bags and even fans! The most common permutation of Puni art is the palaspas we see every Holy Week.</li>
							<li>Because of the abundance of coconut leaves, the Pinoys have ingeniously created toys and other items through Puni. Although fresh coconut or palm leaves are most commonly used, the leaves dry and crumble within a few days. It is now more common to use leaves that are dried, treated and dyed for strength and color.</li>
