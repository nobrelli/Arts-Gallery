					<p>Sculpture, from the Latin word <i>sculpere</i>, meaning "to carve", is the art of making two or three-dimensional representative or abstract forms, especially by carving stone or wood or by casting metal or plaster.</p>
					<br />

						<li>The earliest sculpture is the cave art.</li>
						<li>Ancient sculptures was made to supply magical help to hunters.</li>
						<li>Statues were used to represent gods.</li>
						<li>Ancient kings had likenesses carved; thus, portrait sculpture was born.</li>
						<li>Ancient people used to build large monuments for commemoration.</li>
						<li>Ancient Sumerians celebrated military victory with sculpture.</li>
						<li>The participants of World War II also used sculpture to honor their soldiers.</li>
					</ul>
					<br />
					
					<h2>Modern Sculpture</h2>
					<p>It is defined as sculpture beginning with the work of Auguste Rodin (1840 â€“ 1917) and ending with the advent of Pop Art and Minimalism in the 1960s.</p>
